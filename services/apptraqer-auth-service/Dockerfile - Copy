# ENV SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev

# Step 1: Use a base image with Java (e.g., OpenJDK)
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim as build

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the Gradle project files (build files)
COPY build.gradle settings.gradle ./

# Step 4: Copy the Gradle wrapper (if it's part of your project)
COPY gradlew ./
COPY gradle/wrapper/ ./gradle/wrapper/

# Step 5: Download dependencies
RUN ./gradlew build --no-daemon

# Step 6: Copy the entire source code
COPY src ./src

# Step 7: Build the application
RUN ./gradlew build

# Step 8: Create the final image by using the JAR file produced in the build step
FROM openjdk:23-jdk-slim

WORKDIR /app

# Copy the jar file from the build container (adjust path for Gradle's output)
COPY --from=build /app/build/libs/apptraqer-auth-service.jar apptraqer-auth-service.jar

# Step 9: Expose the application port (same as the Spring Boot config)
EXPOSE 8081

# Step 10: Command to run the Spring Boot application
CMD ["java", "-jar", "apptraqer-auth-service.jar"]
